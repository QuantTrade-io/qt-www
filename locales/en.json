        "q": "What is the idea behind QuantTrade?",
        "a": "The idea behind QuantTrade is that individual traders have the opportunity and access to powerful trading models. The models vary from mean-reverting pair trading to active portfolio management, which can be fully adapted to your wishes. Still unsure? Then use our built-in backtesting solution, with which you can test your strategy on historical data. If that is still not convincing enough for you, there is always the option to use our optimizer software, this uses Machine Learning and historical data to find the perfect parameters for your strategy, so that the profit is maximized against the risk."
      },
      "2": {
        "q": "How can I use QuantTrade?",
        "a": "QuantTrade is currently only available for the browser, but will also appear in the App stores as soon as possible. This way you always and everywhere have access to your account(s) and the trading methods you have running."
      },
      "3": {
        "q": "How do I connect to my broker?",
        "a": "Most brokers we work with offer a so-called API Token, this is a token that you can request from your broker, which gives you access to (almost) all options that your broker also provides. We need this API Token to perform the actions you normally perform via your broker. We have a manual for every broker that shows how this API Token can be generated. Unfortunately, not all brokers issue an API Token, in which case there is not much else to do than to use username/password."
      },
      "4": {
        "q": "What about the safety of my account(s)?",
        "a": "Of course it is exciting to use API Tokens or to provide your username/password, so it is of great importance that this is handled very carefully. All data we have/receive is stored discreetly according to all standards and values required for password storage, only better. The data is encrypted before it is sent to us, so the data will already be safely moved over the internet, when it arrives at us, it will be encrypted again and then stored in the database. The database itself is then also fully encrypted and is completely closed off from the public internet, so the data will not be visible to anyone. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please feel free to contact our support department to ask additional questions."
      },
      "5": {
        "q": "How can I create my own trading strategy?",
        "a": "QuantTrade provides three unique ways to create your own strategy, the first is by using the pre-built templates. These are strategies that are often known among existing traders, which we have worked out down to the last detail. You apply the strategy to a stock you want, with the parameters as you want them. The second option is our Workflow, this is a visual editor where you can assemble all the steps that need to be completed yourself, this does not require any programming knowledge, but gives you full control over how a strategy should work. Finally, we offer the code editor in the browser, which gives you that last bit of control over your idea & strategy and allows you to push our platform to the limit with possibilities."
      },
      "6": {
        "q": "How does the backtesting work?",
        "a": "We offer a so-called backtesting software, in which the strategy stops as if you want to use it live, and is then tested on historical data. This allows you to check whether what you would like to do has already been profitable data. Of course, past performance is no guarantee for the future, but it will still be a big factor in determining whether or not a strategy could work. In addition, we are working very hard to offer the possibility to run strategies in Sandbox mode, which means that the strategy is reflected against real, live data, but the orders will not be officially executed."
      },
      "7": {
        "q": "What if I want to stop or restart a certain trading strategy?",
        "a": "Strategies can be turned on or off at any time. In the case of stopping a strategy, there is the possibility that there are orders ready to buy or sell shares, you will be notified immediately with the option to cancel these orders as well. Strategies that you have developed belong to your account, so it is always possible to turn a strategy back on or adjust it to new insights."
      },
      "8": {
        "q": "What if I want to stop using QuantTrade?",
        "a": "Too bad you have to look here, and we are of course very curious about your reasons for stopping. If the time has come, you can stop your account with several options. The first is a complete delete, which means that all open orders from us will be stopped first, then the strategies will be stopped, then your account will be deleted from QuantTrade (all data is deleted). The second option is a soft delete, where you have the option to choose that some data will remain on the platform. This option will cost you $1 per month for the storage cost of this data, giving you the option to keep/delete the following for potential future use; strategies, backtests, optimizations, API Tokens and username & password(s)."
